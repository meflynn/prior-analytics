title: "Beyond the Wire: US Military Deployments and Host Country Public Opinion"
---

## Question

What do hose country populations think about the US military personnel stationed within their country? 

## Methods

Drawing on a $1.2 million USD Department of Defense Minerva Research Initiative Grant my research team adopted a mixed methods approach to answering this question. These approaches included:

- Surveying over 42,000 people across 14 countries and three years
- Using advanced Bayesian modeling techniques to assess the correlates of attitudes towards various US actors
- Use predictive modeling to identify key clusters of variables that shape individual attitudes
- Use causal inference techniques to assess the causal effect of key variables
