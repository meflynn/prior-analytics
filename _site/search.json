    "text": "What do I offer?\nWhether it’s private businesses, non-profits, or government agencies, people often find themselves trying to solve complex problems. Increasingly these challenges involve wrangling large amounts of data as businesses try to better understand these problems and identify possible solutions.\nMy specialization involves the use of statistical and computational methods to help you at whatever stage of this process your organization may be in. Whether its analyzing large amounts of data, or helping you to figure out how to ask the right questions, I can assist you. Specifically, I offer the following types of services, including but not limited to:\n\nData analysis\nDesigning surveys\nWritten reports\nStatistical analysis\nPublic lectures/presentations\nPrivate/organizational briefings\n\n\n\nMy approach\nI have over a decade of training and experience in the social sciences, blending advanced statistical techniques with a consistent focus on the substantive issues that matter to people. With these skills I can help you and your business adopt a data-driven approach to identify solutions to complex and challenging problems.\nWhile others may have similar technical abilities, by background in political science means that whatever the statistical and computational methods I use, I will always maintain a focus on making sure you can easily identify the key takeaways and solutions that your business cares about.\nBeyond blending advanced statistical methods with a clear and concise presentation, I can also offer you these tools and insight for less than major consulting firms or an in-house data science team would cost. Technology should help us to break down barriers to comprehension, allowing us to better understand the issues we care about—not create more confusion.\nNo matter your needs, my approach always prioritizes developing a better understanding of the underlying patterns of human behavior. To that end I will provide you with clear and concise analyses that meet your needs.\n\n\n\n\n © Copyright , Prior Analytics, LLC. All Rights Reserved."
