He has 15 years of experience working as a researcher, applied statistician, and data analyst. He enjoys working with others to brainstorm new ideas and to help them solve problems. You can find a copy of his CV [here](https://m-flynn.com/files/flynn-cv.pdf).\n\n> During my time as a researcher I've dealt with many different kinds of research problems, and my work requires that I be able to connect technical and specialized research skills with communication skills that make my research accessible to a general audienceâ€”whether that be grant funding agencies or policymakers. My goal is to bring the skills that I've developed over my career to assist others in their own projects.\n\n:::{#hero-heading}\n\n\nPh.D. Political Science |\nBinghamton University, New York | 2013\n\nM.A. Political Science | \nBinghamton University, New York | 2009\n\nB.A History, B.A. Politics | SUNY Potsdam, New York | 2006\n\n## Experience\n\nKansas State University | Associate Professor of Political Science | 2018-Present\n\nKansas State University | Assistant Professor of Political Science | 2014-2018\n\nUniversity of Alabama | Postdoctoral Fellow | 2013-2014\n:::\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"include-in-header":["files/logo-regular.html"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","editor":"source","theme":"cosmo","mainfont":"roboto-light","title":"About Me","image":"files/profile-smaller-2019.png","about":{"template":"jolla","image-width":"45%","image-shape":"round","links":[{"icon":"twitter","text":"Twitter","href":"https://twitter.com/flynnpolsci"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/meflynn"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
