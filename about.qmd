> Michael Flynn is the principal analyst at Prior Analytics. He has 15 years of experience working as a researcher, applied statistician, and data analyst.

> During my time as a researcher I've dealt with many different kinds of research problems, and my work requires that I be able to connect technical and specialized research skills with communication skills that make my research accessible to a general audienceâ€”whether that be grant funding agencies or policymakers. My goal is to bring the skills that I've developed over my career to assist others in their own projects.
