Analyzing data is important, but getting the most out of your data also means asking the right questions and designing your analysis in a way that will give you the information you need to make the best decisions. This requires engaging with stakeholders and subject experts to understand what clients want to know and how best to get answers to the questions that matter.

Trained as a political scientist, I have 15 years of experience developing research projects that are designed to answer questions of substantive interest. Below you can find a brief overview of projects that I've worked on and information on the motivating questions and the methodological approaches that I've adopted.

1. An analysis of public attitudes towards US military deployments overseas
    - Drawing on a $1.2 million USD Department of Defense Minerva Research Initiative Grant my research team adopted a mixed methods approach to answering this question. These approaches included:
    - Surveying over 42,000 people across 14 countries and three years
    - Using advanced Bayesian modeling techniques to assess the correlates of attitudes towards various US actors
    - Use predictive modeling to identify key clusters of variables that shape individual attitudes
    - Use causal inference techniques to assess the causal effect of key variables
    
2. Developing a software package of help researchers access data on US overseas military deployments
    - Reviewing existing literature to assess the state of US military deployment data
    - Identifying trends and changes in the data over time
    - Developing a software package for the `R` programming language to allow users to generate customized data sets on US military deployments
